        /*
         * I have removed the GetCart method and added a Cart parameter to each of the action methods.When the MVC Framework receives 
        a request that requires, say, the AddToCart method to be invoked, it begins by looking at the parameters for the action method.
        It looks at the list of binders available and tries to find one that can create instances of each parameter type.The custom binder 
        is asked to create a Cart object, and it does so by working with the session state feature.Between the custom binder and the default 
        binder, the MVC Framework is able to create the set of parameters required to call the action method, allowing me to refactor the controller 
        so that it has no knowledge of how Cart objects are created when requests are received.

        There are several benefits to using a custom model binder like this. The first is that I have separated the logic used to create a Cart from 
        that of the controller, which allows me to change the way I store Cart objects without needing to change the controller.The second benefit is that 
        any controller class that works with Cart objects can simply declare them as action method parameters and take advantage of the custom model binder.
        The third benefit, and the one I think is most important, is that I can now unit test the Cart controller without needing to mock a lot of ASP.NET plumbing.
